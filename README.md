# Shell Knight


#How to Play 
Use WASD to control the character's movement, J to attack, and K to make the character roll.
#Cheat Mode
Use L to automatically increase experience points. Use spaces to freely switch to new scenes.
#Experience 
Players need to survive as long as possible and earn experience points to get higher scores. Every time a player is born, the map is different. Pay attention to the four monsters and the direction they come from, which is very important for survival!
